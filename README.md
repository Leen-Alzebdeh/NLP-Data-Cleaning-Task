# NLP-Data-Cleaning-Task
We explore the use of regular expressions to clean input text in support of a downstream task.

- Input data: [Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES Talkbank)](https://childes.talkbank.org/)

   The data contains transcripts from oral language that represent the language that young children are exposed to in everyday settings. The data is stored in .cha files.
   ```NLP-Data-Cleaning-Task/
   ├─ Data/
   │  ├─ Bates
   │  │  ├─ Free20
   │  │  │  ├─ amy.cha
   │  │  │  ├─ betty.cha
   │  │  │  ├─ (more files)
   │  │  ├─ (more directories)
   │  ├─ (more directories)```


- The first task will be to **clean** the files:
   - Convert the files to raw text and remove both the header and extraneous information. Extraneous information is any information that is not needed to support the downstream task.
- The second task will be to **transform** the files:
   - You will transform the data so that it uses ArpaBET to represent the sounds that the text maps to. We use[ CMU's Pronunciation Dictionary](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1703650680785817&usg=AOvVaw2B2-NioT8l2i6wmOWx3Cwk) to inform this transformation.
